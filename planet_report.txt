1. Write down your brief thoughts on how you approached this problem.

After reading and watching videos about various algorithms that
helped find the shortest path, I decided to implement the
Krukal's algorithm to create the graph and then apply the dijkastra algorithm
to find the shortest route. 
do this as follows:
first, using Krukal's algorithm, create the minimum spanning tree whichreturn a list 
of edges that represent the graph. Furthermore, using dijkastra's algorithm, iterate 
the calculation of the distances to adjacent nodes, to finally obtain the shortest path, 
as well as the maximum weight of this shortest path



2. What is the complexity of your solution? Can it be improved?

The complexity is quite right for the type of problem that needed to be to carry out.
However, there may be scenarios where Dijkstra's algorithm is not fully efficient,
For example, this algorithm may fail on a graph with negative edge weights.
(i.e., a cycle in the graph for which the sum of edge weights is negative)
